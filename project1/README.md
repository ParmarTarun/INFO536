# Individual Project 1
# MNIST Image Classification

#### Due Date
* Thursday Sep 7, 2023 (23:59)

#### Total Points
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal
In this project, you will be asked to classify MNIST dataset with deep neural networks. You can build any neural nets as you want, for example, you can construct fully-connected layers, or CNNs, or both, etc.. This project should be completed in Python 3. Keras, Pytorch, and Tensorflow are recommended.

* Deep learning package
   * [Keras](https://keras.io/). Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It is easy to learn and use. If you are new to deep learning, you can try to use Keras to get started. [Naive Tutorial](https://github.com/yanhuata/DS504CS586-S20/blob/master/project2/keras_tutorial.ipynb)
